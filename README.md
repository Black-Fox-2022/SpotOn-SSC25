# Swift Student Challenge 2025 - Submission
Welcome to my entry for the Swift Student Challenge 2025! After my last two submissions, I've decided to focus on a specific problem this time instead of creating a fully functional app (see GoalKit & MemoKit).

## SpotOn in ONE sentence
Most people are not sure how to be most effective when calling emergency services, SpotOn tries to remind them of the basics by giving them the opportunity to experience the other side.
