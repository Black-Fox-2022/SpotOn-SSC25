Welcome to my submission for the Swift Student Challenge 2025! After my last two submissions I've decided to focus on one specific issue this time.

## SpotOn in one sentence
Most people are not sure how to be most effective when calling emergency services, SpotOn tries to remind them of the basics by giving them the opportunity to experience the other side. 

## Status

## Technologies
- Swift 5.0: The foundation for the project.
